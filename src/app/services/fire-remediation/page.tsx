              The landscape of building safety has changed considerably since Grenfell.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              What was once acceptable is now under scrutiny. Buildings across England need urgent attention, and the government's Remediation Acceleration Plan has set clear deadlines. By 2029, buildings over 18 metres must have unsafe cladding removed. Buildings over 11 metres face the same deadline. The penalties for non-compliance are severe.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              This isn't just about meeting regulations. It's about protecting lives.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-light mb-6 mt-12">The Challenge Facing Building Owners</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Perhaps you're a building owner wrestling with fire safety compliance. Or a developer trying to navigate PAS 9980 requirements. Maybe you're a housing association facing enforcement action.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The regulations are complex. The deadlines are tight. The cost of getting it wrong extends well beyond financial penalties.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Fire Risk Appraisals of External Walls (FRAEWs) must now follow strict protocols. Materials must meet BS EN 13501 standards. Life-critical fire safety defects demand immediate action. And the Building Safety Regulator is watching closely.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Finding a contractor who understands both the technical requirements and the urgency isn't straightforward.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-light mb-6 mt-12">RMR's Fire Remediation Capabilities</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              We've built our reputation on facades. Over 50 years of combined experience sits within our team. Our Technical Director brings a structural engineering background and four decades of industry knowledge. That expertise now extends to comprehensive fire remediation services.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Our approach is end-to-end. We don't just install solutions designed by others.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">Assessment & Appraisal</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              We conduct thorough fire safety assessments of existing buildings. Our team identifies life-critical defects in external wall systems, cladding configurations, and fire break installations. We understand PAS 9980 requirements and work with certified fire risk assessors to provide accurate FRAEWs that meet regulatory standards.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">Design & Engineering</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Our in-house design team develops remediation solutions tailored to each building's specific challenges. We don't believe in one-size-fits-all approaches. Our designers work closely with fire safety experts to balance compliance requirements with aesthetic considerations and budget constraints. Having everything in-house means faster communication and better outcomes.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">Installation & Upgrade</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Our installation teams deliver the solutions we've designed. This integration matters. When the people installing the work understand the engineering behind it, problems get solved on-site rather than escalating into delays. We hold ISO 9001 certification for quality management, which means robust processes underpin every project.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">Materials & Compliance</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Fire-resistant materials must meet current standards. We work with manufacturers whose products comply with BS EN 13501 classifications. Our specifications align with Building Safety Act requirements and Fire Safety Order obligations. Documentation is thorough because regulatory compliance demands it.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">Integrated Service</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              When assessment, design, and installation sit under one roof, accountability is clear. There's no passing responsibility between contractors. Our project managers stay on-site, working directly with installation teams. Problems get addressed immediately.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">Technical Expertise</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Fire remediation requires specialist knowledge. Our team includes structural engineers who understand how remediation work affects building integrity. We've navigated complex facades on high-rise buildings, transport hubs, and residential estates. That experience counts when specifications need adapting on-site.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">Regulatory Understanding</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Building safety legislation continues evolving. We stay current with requirements from the Building Safety Regulator, changes to Approved Document B, and updates to testing standards. Our clients don't need to become regulatory experts. We translate complex requirements into practical solutions.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">Quality Assurance</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications aren't just badges on our website. They represent systematic approaches to quality management and environmental responsibility. Every project follows documented processes. Regular audits ensure standards are maintained.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">East Anglia Coverage</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Based in Norwich, we effectively serve projects across East Anglia, Cambridgeshire, Essex, and the M25 area. Regional presence means faster response times and better site oversight. Our management teams visit regularly, not just when problems arise.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              We visit site to understand your building's specific challenges. Our team reviews existing fire risk assessments, examines external wall construction, and identifies compliance gaps. This initial consultation is free and involves no obligation.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">Detailed Survey & Specification</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Following initial assessment, we conduct detailed surveys if required. Our design team develops comprehensive specifications for remediation works. These include material selections, installation methodologies, and compliance documentation.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4 text-[#bc1019]">Project Planning</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Method statements and risk assessments are prepared before any work commences. We coordinate with building occupants to minimise disruption. Our dedicated contracts manager oversees communication between all parties.
